# Generalized Machine Learning Workflow Documentation

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to use a generalized machine learning script using Snowpark ML. The script is designed to be modular, allowing you to easily adapt it to different datasets and machine learning tasks.

## Script Overview

The script follows a generalized machine learning workflow, comprising the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Fetches the dataset from a specified Snowflake table.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - **Numerical Columns:** Casts specified numerical columns to float.
   - **Categorical Columns:** One-hot encodes specified categorical columns.
3. **Data Splitting:** Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Definition:** Defines a machine learning pipeline with preprocessing (Standard Scaler) and a classifier (XGBoost Classifier).
5. **Model Training:** Trains the model on the training data.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model on the testing data using several metrics (MAPE, MSE, R2 Score).
7. **Model Saving:** Saves the trained model to a specified location.

## Usage

### 1. Initialization

- Initialize a Snowpark `Session`.
  
### 2. Define Parameters

- Define the following parameters:
   - `database_name`: Name of the Snowflake database.
   - `schema_name`: Name of the schema within the database.
   - `table_name`: Name of the table containing the dataset.
   - `numerical_cols`: List of column names representing numerical features.
   - `categorical_cols`: List of column names representing categorical features.
   - `target_col`: Name of the target column.
   - `stage_location`: Location to save the trained model.

### 3. Execute the Script

- Call the `handler` function with the defined parameters.
- The function will return the evaluation metrics of the trained model.

## Adaptation to Different Datasets

To adapt the script to different datasets, you may need to modify the following:

- **Define Parameters:** Update the column names and table information according to the new dataset.
- **Model Definition:** If a different model is desired, modify the pipeline definition accordingly.
- **Model Evaluation:** Adjust the evaluation metrics as per the task at hand (classification, regression, etc.).
- **Additional Steps:** Depending on the dataset and task, you might need to include additional preprocessing steps, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc.
